### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I like the game Blackjack and I could have the opportunity to make the game myself. With this lab, I was able to write code to differentiate between Face Cards, Number Cards, and Ace's depending value. It was an update from the the last Blackjack game that only allowed 2 numbers, so this lab represented the actual game and cool to play with afterwards.

* Lab 4 
     
     Lab 4, part 1 was memorable because we used functions to convert 5 measurements simultaneously. This lab had us input any amount of milliliters and output with the equivalent amount of teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups. It was interesting to create and utilize the tool in real life like cooking and baking. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was our first time with loops and patterns. I wrote code that utilized loops to make a pattern of dashes, asterisks, and bars with 21 lines. As a result, it made a counting pattern which was satisfying to see.
